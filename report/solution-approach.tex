\subsection*{Model Implementation}

To efficiently solve the group assignment problem under complex diversity and engagement constraints, we implement a heuristic based on Lagrangian relaxation and local search.

The algorithm begins with a random initial assignment of participants to groups and iteratively improves the assignment by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maximizing intra-group diversity,
    \item Minimizing engagement variance,
    \item Satisfying group size, diversity threshold, and minimum engagement constraints.
\end{itemize}

Due to the difficulty of directly enforcing the quadratic diversity constraint, we relax it using Lagrangian multipliers $\mu_j \geq 0$, converting it into a penalized term in the objective function. The algorithm alternates between:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Primal update:} Local randomized reassignment of participants to groups to improve the Lagrangian objective.
    \item \textbf{Dual update:} Updating multipliers $\mu_j$ via subgradient ascent based on constraint violations.
\end{enumerate}

A repair step is performed at the end to correct any residual constraint violations.
