By formulating the group formation challenge as an integer optimization problem,
we present a flexible and interpretable approach for assigning participants to deliberative groups.
Our model explicitly controls group size, diversity,
and engagement balanceâ€”capabilities missing in traditional clustering-based techniques.
The inclusion of a Linear Programming relaxation enables faster solution times for large-scale instances,
making the method practically applicable.
We expect the resulting groups to be more balanced and representative, improving discussion quality
and legitimacy in vTaiwan and similar participatory platforms.
