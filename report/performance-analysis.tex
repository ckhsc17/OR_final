Solving the full integer program is computationally intensive for large-scale deliberation scenarios.
We therefore introduce an LP relaxation that allows for fractional assignment,
which can be interpreted probabilistically or rounded for implementation.
This approximation provides computational tractability while still producing guidance for effective group formation.
